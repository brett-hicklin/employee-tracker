# Employee Tracker

## Description

In this project, I created a database to track current employees, their employee ID, title, salary, and department for a given company. It utlizes MYSQL, node.js, and inquirer. This allows an employer to keep a database of all their employees, and some crucial information associated with the employee. I learned a lot about using other features of Inquirer, but mostly I learned how to use MYSQL to create, read, update and delete databases.

## Installation

 ```
  npm i
  ```

## Usage

To use this Employee Tracker locally in the console, 
 type 
```
node index.js
```

Once it has started, select an option from the menu. You can view all the departments, view all the roles, or view all the employees. If you choose to view any of the above options, you will be presented with the tables via the console.table package in the terminal. You can also add a new department, add a new role, or add a new employee. Finally, you can update employee's roles as well. Just follow the prompts for the option you chose, and you will receive a "success" message if your addition or change was successful.
